# Alexa-Voice-Automation-with-Desktoip
It is a Voice Automated Alexa which can perform simple task on Desktop

###I tried following task with her :-
1.Asking for Date & Time
2.Walking through File Explorer
3.Asking current directory
4.Asking file on any directory
5.Opening and Closing any file(img, song, etc)
6.Take a Screenshot
7.Draw a Square of desire size in MS Paint
8.Opening Camera and take photos
9.Changing Desktop Wallpaper
10.Shutdown


***Bug:-*** In walking through the file explorer, every time I open new tab, not able to process in same tab by command line (I don't want to use pyautogui). If any one can solve this bug, please share with us.
